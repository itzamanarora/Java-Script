    <script>
        //Arthmetic Operators -- Used to Operator that operate upon the numerical values and return Numberical values.

        // Assignment Operators -- Used to asign Values to Variable in JS

        let d = 30;
        let e = 20;

        a += b;

        // Comparsion Operators -- Used to Compare or check conditions and making decisions in JS

        let f = 50;
        let g = 60;
 
        console.log("Comparsion Operator: " + f == g); //Campare the equality of two operands.

        console.log("Comparsion Operator: " + f <= g); //Check the left side operands is smaller than or equal to the right side operands.
        console.log("Comparsion Operator: " + f < g); //Check the left side operands is smaller than to the right side operands.
        console.log("Comparsion Operator: " + f === g); //Compare the equality of two operands and their types.
        console.log("Comparsion Operator: " + f !== g); //Compare the Inequality of two operands and their types.

    </script>

    <script>
        // Logical Operators -- Used to perform Logical Operations on values and return either true or fasle in JS. Commoly used in If-Else, and Loops.

        //Both Condition should be true.
    if(a == b && c == d) {
        
            console.log("Logical Operators: If")

        // Ternary Operators -- The Ternary Operator in JS is a Shortcut for writing simple If-else

        let Marks = 50;

        let Results = (Marks > 40 ) ? "Pass" : "False" ;
        console.log("Ternary Operators: "  + Results);

        //Comma Operator -- This Comma Operator mainly evalutues its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand.
