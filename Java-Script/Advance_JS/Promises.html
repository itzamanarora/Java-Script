            Promises

    <p><strong>Promises: </strong> Promises is for 'eventual' completion of task. It is an object in JS.</p>
    <p>
        It is a solution to callback hell.
    </p>
    <p>let promise = new promise((resolve, reject) => {
        });</p>

    <p><Strong>NOTE:</Strong> resolve and reject are callback provided by JS. </p>

    <p>A js promise object can be: </p>
    <p>* PENDING: The result is undefined.</p>
    <p>* RESOLVED: The result is a value(fulfiled)</p>
    <p>* REJECTED: The result is an error object.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Promise has state(pending, fulfilled), and some result(result for resolve & error for reject).</p>
